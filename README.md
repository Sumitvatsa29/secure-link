INTRODUCTION :-
Dynamic Malicious Link Detection and Highlighting Web Extension


PROBLEM STATEMENT :-
Develop a web extension that enhances user security by dynamically identifying and highlighting potentially 
malicious or suspicious links on webpages. The extension should utilize a machine learning model to 
classify links in real-time, alerting users visually to the presence of dangerous links without requiring their active intervention.


OVERVIEW :- 
Secure link is a browser extension designed to enhance user security by dynamically identifying and highlighting potentially malicious or suspicious links on webpages. The extension using a machine learning model to classify links in real-time, visually alerting users to the presence of dangerous links without requiring active intervention.
